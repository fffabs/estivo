You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Get in touch if you’re interested! (Any retweets appreciated) :)</p>&mdash; ғάвισ ↬ (@fffabs) <a href="https://twitter.com/fffabs/status/530722531272323073">November 7, 2014</a></blockquote>

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight coffeescript %}
layerA.animate
    properties:
        x:200
    curve: "ease-in-out"

layerA.on Events.AnimationEnd, ->
    layerA.animate
        properties:
            x:100
        curve: "ease-in-out"
{% endhighlight %}
